# Hi, I'm Pranav Goteti

I'm a second-year Computer Science major at the University of Virginia, also pursuing a minor in Data Science. I enjoy building clean, high-impact software, especially full stack or AI-driven systems that combine design with real functionality.

### 🛠️ Technologies I Use

- **Frontend**: React (web), Flutter (iOS – [Pickl app](https://github.com/ColdBlitz101/picklnairted))
- **Backend**: Django, Node.js, Firebase
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, OpenAI APIs (for adversarial prompts and model auditing)
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, AWS (used for deploying and scaling cloud-based systems)

---

### 📌 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **Pickl** – A mobile app that helps groups reach consensus through individual swipes and group aggregation (Flutter + Firebase).
- **LLM Audit Tool** – Research project evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in LLMs, using adversarial prompts and behavior tracking (Python + PyTorch).
- **Clothing Lending Library** – Django-based web app supporting Google OAuth, AWS S3 integration, and role-based borrowing features.

> Note: The Clothing Lending Library project was originally deployed on Heroku, but the public version is now hosted here for source visibility only.
